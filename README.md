# The Atmos Project

The Atmos Project is a relaxation project based within a multi-media consumption based app.

> The foundation of the project is a multi-media consumption app that allows the users to simultaneously listen to their preferred genre of music via Spotify while viewing a playlist of curated atmospheric videos via YouTube.

> The user inputs their preference of audio and visual content into the custom menu and a media dashboard is generated playing the content they chose. The user can then change the content options from within the dashboard (change videos, playlists, songs, etc.) or can return to the menu for a new combination of options.
